<Name>Manoeuvre Management</Name>

<BasedOn>
This pattern is essentially identical to the manoeuvre management pattern of the
<a HREF="http://www.aut.ee.ethz.ch/~pasetti/AocsFramework/index.html">AOCS Framework</a> (see also:
A. Pasetti, <i>Embedded Control Systems and Software Frameworks</i>, Springer-Verlag, 2002).
It can also be seen as an instance of the <a href="Manager.html">manager design pattern</a>.
</BasedOn>

<Intent>
Decouple the management of manoeuvres from their implementation.
</Intent>

<Motivation>
<p>
The term <i>manoeuvre</i> is used here to designate a sequence of actions that must
be performed by an application at specified times to achieve a specified goal.
Although individual manoeuvres - to slew an antenna, to perform a unit switch-on
sequence, etc - exist in almost any OBS application, their diversity is such that
usually no concept of abstract manoeuvre is used. This also means that there is
usually no attempt made to manage manoeuvres in a uniform manner. This lack of
uniformity is incompatible with software reuse and with a framework approach.
</p><p>
This design pattern introduces a manoeuvre abstraction that allows the <i>management</i>
of a generic manoeuvre to be done in a manner that is independent of the <i>implementation</i>
of the manoeuvre, namely of the actions that must be performed to execute the manoeuvre.
</p>
</Motivation>

<Structure>
<p>
This design pattern postulates the encapsulation of manoeuvres in components and
proposes an abstract interface <CODE>Manoeuvre</CODE> to characterize them.
An abstract manoeuvre is characterized by:
<ul>
<li>the actions that are associated to the manoeuvres.</li>
<li>a <i>start  check</i> that verifies whether manoeuvre execution can start.
Depending on the manoeuvre, readiness to start can be defined by a time tag or
by the occurrence of certain operational conditions.</li>
<li>a <i>continuation check</i> that verifies whether an on-going manoeuvre can
continue its execution.</li>
<li>a <i>termination check</i> that verifies whether the manoeuvre has terminated
execution. Depending on the manoeuvre, termination can be defined by a time tag or
by the achievement of pre-specified operational conditions.</li>
</ul>
The introduction of an abstract interface to characterize manoeuvres, makes it
possible to introduce a manoeuvre manager component responsible for executing them.
Since it sees the manoeuvres only through the abstract interface <code>Manoeuvre</code>, the
manoeuvre manager can be developed as an application-independent component that can
be reused across applications without changes to its source code.
</p><p>
The manoeuvre manager maintains a list of components of abstract type <code>Manoeuvre</code>.
Whenever it is activated, it goes through the list and checks the status of each
pending manoeuvre. If a pending manoeuvre has not yet started, then the manoeuvre
manager asks it to perform a start check (method <code>canStart</code>). If this is
successful, the manoeuvre manager starts the execution of the manoeuvre. If a manoeuvre is already
executing, then the manoeuvre manager asks it to perform a continuation check (method
<code>canContinue</code>). If this is successful, then the manoeuvre manager advances the
execution of the manoeuvre (method <code>doContinue</code>). Finally, the manoeuvre manager
asks executing manoeuvres to perform a termination check (method <code>isFinished</code>).
If the outcome of the check indicates that the manoeuvre has terminated execution, then
the manoeuvre manager removes it from its list of pending manoeuvres and unloads it.
</p>
<p>
The manoeuvre manager exposes a <code>load</code> method to allow clients to load manoeuvres
that must be executed. Note that there is no corresponding <code>unload</code> method
because removal from the list of pending manoeuvres is done autonomously and internally
to the manoeuvre manager when a manoeuvre has terminated its execution. An <code>abort</code>
method could however be provided to allow clients to force the interruption of the execution
of pending manoeuvres.

<Collaborations>
The typical operational scenario for this design pattern is:
<ul>
<li>A client component wishes a manoeuvre to be executed. The manoeuvre is encapsulated in an object that
implements interface <CODE>Manoeuvre</CODE>. The client component loads the manoeuvre object in the manoeuvre
manager by using its <code>load</code> method. </li>
<li>The manoeuvre manager periodically checks the status of the loaded manoeuvre and advances its
execution accodingly</li>
<li>When execution of the manoeuvre is terminated, the manoeuvre manager unloads the manoeuvre</li>
</ul>
</Collaborations>

<Consequence>
The management of manoeuvres is decoupled from their implementation. New manoeuvres
can be added and existing manoeuvres can be modified without impact on the code
that performs the manoeuvre management and on the code that uses the manoeuvres.
</Consequence>

<Consequence>
The manoeuvre management code (the manoeuvre manager component) can be developed as an
application-independent component reusable without changes across applications.
</Consequence>

<Consequence>
For each manoeuvre, a dedicated class implementing interface <CODE>Manoeuvre</CODE> must
be created. This may lead to a proliferation of small classes.
</Consequence>

<Applicability>
This design pattern is useful when:
<ul>
<li> there is a need to handle sequences of actions but the implementation of these
actions can vary from application to application.
</li>
<li> there is a need to decouple the implementation of these sequences of actions from
their managegement.
</li>
</ul>
</Applicability>

<ImplementationIssue>
What operations should be defined by the <CODE>Manoeuvre</CODE> interface? In addition
to those defined above, there might be other housekeeping operations. One notable example
could be an operation to abort an on-going manoeuvre.
</ImplementationIssue>

<ImplementationIssue>
There is an obvious similarity between manoeuvres as defined here and telecommands as defined
in the <a HREF="TelecommandManagement.html">telecommand management design pattern</a>. Both
categories of components encapsulate actions that must be performed on the (or by the) on-board
software. Perhaps the main conceptual difference is that telecommands are intended to be performed
in one shot whereas the execution of manoeuvres extends over time. This is not an essential difference
though, because telecommands could be seen as special cases of manoeuvres with a punctual execution
(their <CODE>isFinished</CODE> method always returns true). In the concept proposed here, manoeuvres
and telecommands are kept separate primarily because they are normally seen as distinct by the on-board
application designers but also for implementation reasons. Telecommands have special implementation needs
because, unlike other components in an on-board application, they must be created dynamically upon reception
of messages from the ground. This requirement is likely to have an impact on the management of the telecommands
and advises against treating them as a special kind of manoeuvres.
</ImplementationIssue>

<ImplementationIssue>
In a typical implementation, the on-board software will internally store a number of manoeuvre components
to perform often recurring manoeuvre such as antenna slews or unit switch-on sequences. When conditions
warrant it or when the ground commands it, one of these pre-defined manoeuvre components can be loaded into
the manoeuvre manager (by calling its <CODE>load</CODE> method). This will cause the manoeuvre to
be executed.

<SampleCode>
<p>
As an example of a concrete manoeuvre consider the case of an application that, upon entry into normal mode,
must switch on a certain unit. Assume moreover that the switch-on procedure may extend over a maximum of 4
cycles spanning the interval between the time when the switch-on command is sent to the unit and the time
when the unit, after completing its initialization procedure, is fully operational. This switch-on procedure
can be implemented as a manoeuvre component. This means that it must be implemented as an instance of a
class <CODE>SwitchOnUnit</CODE> that implements interface <CODE>Manoeuvre</CODE>. The basic definition of
this class could be as follows:
<PRE>
    class SwitchOnUnit : Manoeuvre {

        bool canStart() {
          . . .    // return true if operational mode is NORMAL_MODE
        }
        
        void doContinue() {
        . . .    // The first time the method is called,
        . . .    // send a switch-on command to the unit.
        . . .    // Afterwards, do nothing
        }
        
        bool canContinue() {
        . . .    // return true if the number of cycles elapsed
        . . .    // since the manoeuvre started is less than four
        }
        
        bool isFinished() {
        . . .    // return true if the unit is operational
        }

    }</PRE>

An instance of this manoeuvre should be loaded into the manoeuvre manager before
the application enters normal mode. The code to load it might look like this:
<PRE>
    Manoeuvre* switchOnUnit = new SwitchOnUnit();
    . . .
    ManoeuvreManager* manoeuvreManager;
    . . .
    manoeuvreManager->load(switchOnUnit);
</PRE>

After it is loaded, the execution of the manoeuvre is entirely under the control of
the manoeuvre manager and the component that created and loaded it need no longer
be concerned with it.
</p><p>
As a second example of sample code, consider the manoeuvre manager. If the
<CODE>Manoeuvre</CODE> interface is as hypothesized in the pattern class diagram,
then its core could be implemented as follows:
<PRE><![CDATA[    class ManoeuvreManager {

        // list of pending manoeuvres
        Manoeuvre* manoeuvreList[N];
        . . .
    
        void activate() {
    
            for (int j:=0; j++; j<N)
            {	if (manoeuvreList[j]->canStart())
                        if (manoeuvreList[j]->canContinue())
                            manoeuvreList[j]->doContinue();
                        else
                        . . .// abort manoeuvre
                        if (manoeuvreList[j]->isFinished())
                        . . .// remove manoeuvre from manoeuvreList[]
            }
        }
    
        void load(Manoeuvre* newManoeuvre) {
            . . .	// add newManoeuvre to manoeuvreList[]
        }
    }]]></PRE>

In this implementation, the manoeuvre manager maintains a list of pending manoeuvres.
The manoeuvre manager is intended to be periodically activated by some external agency
(perhaps a scheduler). When it is activated it goes through the list of pending manoeuvres
and checks which are ready to start. On active manoeuvres, it checks which ones are in a
condition to continue execution and on the latter it calls method <CODE>doContinue</CODE>
to advance the manoeuvre execution. Finally, the manoeuvre manager checks whether manoeuvres
have terminated their execution and, if they have, removes them from the list of pending manoeuvres.
</p><p>
In a more realistic implementation, the manoeuvre manager would also perform other
housekeeping operations such as recording execution or abortion of manoeuvres in a
history area. The important point however is that all the operations performed
by the manoeuvre manager are independent of the manoeuvre implementation and that
therefore the manoeuvre manager is a potentially reusable component.
