/** 
* Base class from which most framework classes are - directly or indirectly -
* derived.
* This class defines four attributes and four services that are made available to
* its children classes.
* The attributes are: <ul>
* <li>The instance identifier,</li>
* <li>The class identifier,</li>
* <li>The system event repository,</li>
* <li>The system data pool, and</li>
* <li>The system parameter database.</li>
* </ul>
* The <i>instance identifier</i> is an integer that uniquely identifies each
* object instantiated from this class or its subclasses.
* The instance identifier is automatically assigned by the
* <code>CC_RootObject</code> constructor when a new instance of this class
* is created. It can be read but cannot be changed after an object has
* been created.
* <p>
* The <i>class identifier</i> is an integer that uniquely identifies each
* class derived from <code>CC_RootObject</code>.
* It is useful during debugging and could be used to implement a simple form of
* run-time type identification.
* The class identifier should be set during the application instantiation
* phase and it is intended never to be changed afterwards.
* Only concrete classes are endowed with a class identifier.
* <p>
* The <i>system data pool</i> is an instance of class <code>DataPool</code> that
* is implemented as a static plug-in component for class <code>CC_RootObject</code>. 
* In general, applications instantiated
* from the OBS Framework should have only one data pool component. The 
* <code>CC_RootObject</code> class makes this single data pool instance
* globally accessible to all OBS Framework classes.
* <p>
* The <i>system event repository</i> is an instance of class <code>DC_EventRepository</code> that
* is implemented as a static plug-in component for class <code>CC_RootObject</code>. 
* In general, applications instantiated
* from the OBS Framework should use only one event repository. The 
* <code>CC_RootObject</code> class makes this single event repository instance
* globally accessible to all OBS Framework classes.
* <p>
* The <i>system parameter database</i> is an instance of class <code>ParameterDatabase</code> that
* is implemented as a static plug-in component for class <code>CC_RootObject</code>. 
* In general, applications instantiated
* from the OBS Framework should have only one parameter database component. The 
* <code>CC_RootObject</code> class makes this single parameter database instance
* globally accessible to all OBS Framework classes.
* <p>
* The services implemented by the <code>CC_RootObject</code> class are: <ul>
* <li>a object configuration check service,</li>
* <li>a system configuration check service, and</li>
* <li>a tracing service.</li>
* </ul>
* The <i>object configuration check service</i> allows an external entity to
* ask an object instantiated from a class derived from 
* <CODE>CC_RootObject</CODE> to check whether it is
* configured.
* The term <i>configuration</i> is used to designate the operations that are
* performed on an object during the
* application initialization phase to prepare it to perform its allotted
* task during the application operational phase.
* Generally speaking, an object is configured if all its plug-in
* objects have been loaded and if all its internal data structures have been
* created and initialized.
* <p>
* The <i>system configuration check service</i> allows an external entity to
* verify whether all objects instantiated from a class derived from 
* <CODE>CC_RootObject</CODE> are configured.
* The <CODE>CC_RootObject</CODE> class internally defines a static data
* structure that holds references to all objects that
* have been instantiated from its subclasses.
* This data structure is called the <i>system list</i>.
* The system list data structure is loaded by the <CODE>RootObject</CODE>
* constructor: every time a new object is created, its
* reference is loaded into the data structure.
* The system configuration check service goes through the objects in the
* system list data structure and performs a
* configuration check on each one of them.
* If any of the objects in the system list reports: "not
* configured", then the system configuration
* service reports: "system not configured".
* The system configuration check should be performed at the end of the
* framework instantiation phase to
* confirm the correctness of the instantiation procedure.
* <p>
* The <i>tracing service</i> allows an object instantiated from a class derived from 
* <CODE>CC_RootObject</CODE> to ask for a trace
* signal to be generated.
* The requesting object only has to specify an identifier defining the
* content of the trace signal.
* All other operations related to the sending of the trace signal are handled 
* by a static plug-in object of type <code>Tracer</code>.
* Two types of tracing signals can be generated: synch trace and
* and packet trace.
* The presence of this service in the root class means that all framework
* objects have easy access to the tracing
* service and can easily ask for trace signals to be sent to an external
* test set-up.
* @todo change the name of isObjectConfigured to isConfigured
* @todo fix the policy for inline methods. Currently, all header files that define
* inline methods include the corresponding "_inl" file. This should make it 
* unnecessary for the "_inl" file to be included by the body files. This must be checked
* on the ERC32 simulator. If confirmed, all inclusions of "_inl" files in body
* files should be removed.

* @see DataPool
* @see ParameterDatabase
* @see Tracer
