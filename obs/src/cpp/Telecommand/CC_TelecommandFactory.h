/**
 * Dynamic factory for components of type: <code>Telecommand</code>.
 * A <i>dynamic factory</i> is a component that manages a pool of instances of
 * components of a certain type. Clients of the factory can require one of these
 * instances at run-time. After the factory hands over a component instance to its
 * client, the instance is marked as "in use" and cannot be given to any other
 * clients. When the requesting client has finished using the instance, it should release
 * it by marking it as "no longer in use". This will allow the factory to make it
 * available to other clients that request it. The "in use" status of the component
 * instances is controlled through method <code>setInUse</code> declared on
 * the component instances.
 * <p>
 * A dynamic factory is configured in two steps. The first step is performed
 * by the factory constructor when the internal data structures to hold the component
 * instances are created. The second step is performed during application initialization
 * when the component instances are loaded in the factory. Reconfiguration at run time
 * during normal application operation is not allowed.
 * <p>
 * Dynamic factories are implemented as singletons. They can exist in one single instance
 * that can be accessed through the <code>getInstance</code> method.
 * The one single instance of the class is created the first time that method
 * getInstance is called. In order to avoid possible disruptions of
 * real-time behaviour, applications should ensure that this method has been called
 * at least once before the application enters its operational phase.
 * <p>
 * This factory manages the following component instances:<ul>  
 * <li>Number of instances of type <code>DC_DummyPUSTelecommand</code>: 1</li>    
 * <li>Number of instances of type <code>DC_DummyTelecommand</code>: 2</li>    
 * <li>Number of instances of type <code>DC_PUSControlDataReporting</code>: 1</li>    
 * <li>Number of instances of type <code>DC_PUSDefineDataReporting</code>: 1</li>    
 * <li>Number of instances of type <code>DC_PUSDumpMemoryAbsolute</code>: 1</li>    
 * <li>Number of instances of type <code>DC_PUSDumpMemoryOffset</code>: 1</li>    
 * <li>Number of instances of type <code>DC_PUSMemoryLoadAbsolute</code>: 2</li>    
 * <li>Number of instances of type <code>DC_PUSMemoryLoadOffset</code>: 1</li>    
 * <li>Number of instances of type <code>DC_TestPUSTelecommand</code>: 3</li>    
 * </ul>
 * The code for this class was automatically generated by an XSL program processing
 * the XML-based application model.
