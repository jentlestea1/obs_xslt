 * received an "execute" request but could not be executed because the execution
 * check returned "action cannot execute".</li>
 * <li><code>ACTION_RESET</code>: default value used for the <i>last outcome</i>
 * of a punctual action after the punctual action has been reset or initialized.</li>
 * <li><code>MEM_LOAD_PRE_CHECKSUM_FAILED</code>: action outcome that is specific to
 * class <code>PUSMemoryLoad</code>.</li>
 * <li><code>PACKET_NOT_FOUND</code>: action outcome that is returned
 * when a telemetry packet is requested from the telemetry packet factory 
 * but the factory does not have the requested packet.</li>
 * <li><code>PUS_MODE_MAN_FULL</code>: action outcome that is returned when 
 * an attempt is made to load a telemetry packet in the PUS telemetry mode manager
 * but this fails because the mode manager is full.</li>
 * <li><code>TM_MAN_QUEUE_FULL</code>: action outcome that is returned
 * when an attempt is made to load a telemetry packet in the immediate dispatch
 * queue of the telemetry manager but the operation cannot be performed because
 * the queue is full.</li>
 * <li><code>APP_DATA_INCONSISTENT</code>: action outcome that is returned when
 * a telecommand finds that its application data are inconsistent.</li>
