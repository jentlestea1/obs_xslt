 * Depending on the value of the #define constant MS_HOST, the output
 * device is either the file 'out' or the standard output.
 * Messages to the file 'out' are written in HTML. Messages to the
 * standard output are written as plain text.

 * NB: This function is intended for use in a desktop environment where a file
 * system is available. However, it can also be used in embedded environment
 * provided that the <code>printf</code> library function is available. For this
