    <Introduction>
        <p>The table below lists the syntactical constructs that are specific to the C++ language
            and that are used in the OBS Framework code. For each construct, a brief explanation of
            why it is included is given. Language features and constructs that are not explicitly
            listed in the table are never used in the framework code. The selected constructs
            represent a small subset of all the constructs offered by the C++ language and they in
            particular exclude all its dangerous or ambiguous features.</p>

                    negative impacts on code size, it is used in only two situations. Firstly, it
                    may be used with accessor methods (so-called "getter" and "setter" methods) that
                    simply get or set the value of an atomic property. Secondly, it may be used
                    where a method is implemented by delegation to another method (for an example,
                    see method <code>createEventReport</code> in class <code>CC_RootObject</code>) </td>
