    <Introduction>
        <p class="links">Applications instantiated from the OBS Framework will often have to undergo a
            qualification process. The direct qualification of the OBS Framework is not possile for
            two reasons. Firstly, different applications will need different levels of
            qualifications or will need qualifications to be performed with respect to different
            standards. Secondly, some of the building blocks offered by the framework, notably its
            meta-components and its design patterns, would be very difficult to qualify because of
            the lack of experience in the qualification of this type of software constructs. Hence,
            the OBS Framework puts the emphasis less on <i>qualitification</i> than on
            <i>qualifiability</i> in the sense that it tries to implement mechanisms and to provide
            evidence that will facilitate the qualification of applications that use its assets.
            This page describes these mechanisms and this evidence.</p>
    </Introduction>
    <h3><a name="CppCodeQuality">Cpp Code Quality</a></h3>
        <p class="links">One important step taken to ensure the ease of qualification of applications that are
            instantiated from the OBS Framework concerns the precautions that were taken to enhance
            the quality of the code in the <a HREF="indexConcreteComponents.html" target="_parent">concrete components</a> and <a HREF="indexAbstractInterfaces.html" target="_parent">abstract interfaces</a> provided by the framework. These
            precautions fall under three headings:</p>
        <p class="links"><ul>
            <li>The syntactical constructs used in the coding are restricted to a small subset of
                the full C++ language</li>
            <li>Coding rules are used that are designed to increase the robustness of the code</li>
            <li>Naming convention are used that are designed to increase the readability of the code</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p class="links">The <a href="LanguageSubset.html">language subset</a> was selected to exclude any
            constructs that are not safe, or that might lead to ambiguous code, or that might
            introduce high memory and execution overheads. The language subset used for the
            frameworks is intended to be within the <a href="http://www.caravan.net">EC++
            subset</a>. However, formal compliance could not be confirmed because the framework code
            was not compiled with an EC++ compiler.</p>
        <p class="links">Coding rules were defined for the OBS framework with the intention of:</p>
        <p class="links"><ul>
            <li>reducing the likelihood that coding errors are introduced</li>
            <li>improving the likelihood that coding errors are caught during review or debugging</li>
            <li>improving the readability of the code</li>
            <li>reducing the size of the generated code</li>
            <li>improving the efficiency of the code</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p class="links">The coding rules adopted in the OBS Frameworks are divided into two categories. Firstly,
            some rules were taken from the coding rules defined in issue 1 of the "C and C++ Coding
            Standard" prepared by the ESA Board for Software Standardisation and Control (BSSC). A
                <a href="ComplianceWithEsaCodingStandard.html">compliance matrix</a> has been
            constructed to define which of the rules in the ESA standard have been adopted and to
            justify the rejection or modification of some of the others. Secondly, other rules were
            defined specifically for the OBS frameworks. They represent the <a href="ProjectSpecificCodingRules.html">project-specific coding rules</a>.</p>
        <p class="links">The <a href="ProjectSpecificNamingConventions.html">naming conventions</a> adopted in the
            OBS framework are introduced to improve the readability of the code.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="CppCodeDocumentation">Cpp Code Documentation</a></h3>
        <p class="links">The code in the <a HREF="indexConcreteComponents.html" target="_parent">concrete
            components</a> and <a HREF="indexAbstractInterfaces.html" target="_parent">abstract
            interfaces</a> provided by the OBS Framework is documented to a very high standard and
            to a very high level of detail. All classes and all public and protected fields are
            documented according to the standard that is usual in Java applications and using a
            JavaDoc-style. The documentation is directly embedded in the code which helps minimizes
            the danger of the code and its documentation going of synch (see the description of the
                <a href="indexSourceCode.html#CppCodeDocumentation">code documentation approach</a>).</p>
    
    <h3><a name="TestSuite">Test Suite</a></h3>
        <p class="links">The framework code is delivered with a set of test cases. Each test case is aimed at one
            single framework component and is designed to exercise a subset of the component
            functionalities. There is at least one test case for each framework component and some
            components have more than one test case associated to it.</p>
        <p class="links">Each test case is encapsulated in a C++ class that directly or indirectly inherits from
            class <a href="doxygen/html/classTestCase.html">
                <code>TestCase</code>
            </a>. The specific tests performed by a test cases are listed in the class comment
            (click <a href="doxygen/html/classTestCaseFSM__1.html">here</a> for an example). This
            information can be used to build test coverage matrices.</p>
        <p class="links">A program is provided to run all the test cases in sequence. This program is
            called<i>RegressionTest</i>. The regression test program generates as an output a test
            report that describes the outcome of each test case. The test report is organized as an
            HTML file with hyperlinks to the test cases (click <a href="doxygen/html/RegressionTestReport.html">here</a> for an example). The test cases
            aim at full statement coverage of the OBS Framework code. The current level of test
            coverage is over 90%. Test coverage is measured with the <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-3.0/gcc_8.html#SEC132">gcov</a> tool from the
            gcc tool set.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="FormalApplicationModel">Formal Application Model</a></h3>
        <p class="links">The <a href="indexModellingApproach.html">modelling approach</a> adopted by the OBS
            Framework allows a formal model of an application to be instantiated from the OBS
            Framework to be built as an XML file and to be validated against an XSD schema. This
            model can be used as a formal specification of the application. Its formal character
            helps avoid ambiguities and paves the way to the execution of automatic checks on the
            correctness of the specifications.</p>
        <p class="links">The XML-based application model can be used to drive the generation of
            application-specific code by the meta-components. This gives application designers the
            option to have an automatic generation of the final code - and possibly of an entire
            application - from its specifications.</p>
        <p class="links">Future releases of the OBS Framework will provide tools to support the construction of
            the application model from the framework model thus further enhancing confidence in the
            correctness of the framework instantiation process.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="MetaComponents">Meta Components</a></h3>
        <p class="links">The qualification process must normally be applied to the end-code of the user
            application. The OBS Framework offers five kinds of building blocks. Of these, only two
            - the abstract interfaces and the concrete components - are intended to be directly
            included in the end-code of an application instantiated from the framework. Of the
            remaining types of building blocks, the design patterns do not directly contribute to
            the final application and are therefore not relevant to the qualification problem
            whereas the meta-components are used to either modify framework components to adapt them
            to the needs of a target application or to generate new application-specific components.
            In respect of the meta-components, two basic approaches are possible:</p>
        <p class="links"><ul>
            <li>The meta-components are qualified and this qualification process is regarded as
                sufficient to guarantee that the modified/generated components are of suitable
                quality and therefore not in need of a dedicated qualification process</li>
            <li>Only the modified/generated components are qualified and the meta-components are not
                subjected to any qualification process.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p class="links">The OBS Framework takes the second of these two options since qualification of the
            meta-components is regarded as too difficult to perform in practice. This choice has two
            consequences. The first and obvious one is that there is no need to qualify the
            meta-components. The second one is that the quality of the code generated by the
            meta-components - either as code for a newly generated component or as new code inserted
            into a modified component - must be such as to make its qualification easy. The
            meta-components provided by the OBS Framework are intended to satisfy this constraint in
            the sense that the code they generate:</p>
        <p class="links"><ul>
            <li>complies with the same <a href="#CppCodeQuality">coding rules</a> laid down for
                manually written code</li>
            <li>adheres to the same <a href="#CppCodeQuality">language subset</a> specified for
                manually written code</li>
            <li>is commented to the same level as manually written code</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p class="links">The last point in particular implies that the detailed documentation for the
            generated/modified components can be automatically generated by using the doxygen
            facility as is done for all OBS Framework components (see the discussion of the <a href="indexSourceCode.html#CppCodeDocumentation">C++ code documentation</a>).</p>
    
    <h3><a name="SoftwareDocumentation">Software Documentation</a></h3>
        <p class="links">The OBS Framework supports the software documentation process for applications
            instantiated from it by structuring the information it offers in such a way as to allow
            its use within application software documents. More specifically, it is expected that
            application developers can either directly include documentation items provided by the
            OBS Frameworks in their documents or can make these items applicable by referring to
            them through hyperlinks. It should also be noted that all of the raw information offered
            by the OBS Environment is encoded in XML files. The OBS Frameworks provides XSLT
            programs that render them as HTML documents but users with special documentation
            requirements can modify the XSLT programs to generate documents in other formats (e.g.
            PDF) or with other layouts.</p>
        <p class="links">The type of documentation items that can be used by application developers and their mode
            of usage depend on the software development process. However some guidelines are as follows:</p>
        <p class="links"><ul>
            <li>
                <i>User Requirements</i>: the terms in the <a href="indexDomainDictionary.html" target="_parent">domain dictionary</a> can be used to help formulate the user
                requirements in a manner that is more precise and more concise.</li>
            <li>
                <i>Software Logical Model</i>: if an application is based on the use of the OBS
                Design Patterns to implement certain functionalities, then the design patterns
                define the logical model for these functionalities. The <a HREF="indexDesignPatterns.html" target="_parent">design pattern description</a>
                can be directly included or referred to by the document that specifies the software
                logical model for the target application.</li>
            <li>
                <i>Software Requirements</i>: the application model (see the OBS Framework <a HREF="indexModellingApproach.html" target="_parent"> modelling approach</a>) can
                be used as a specification of the target application at software requirement level. </li>
            <li>
                <i>Software Detailed Design</i>: applications that are built by using components
                provided by the OBS Framework can use their component-level documentation (see the
                OBS Framework <a HREF="indexSourceCode.html#CppCodeDocumenation" target="_parent">
                    code documentation approach</a>. </li>
            <li>
                <i>Unit Level Testing</i>: if an application uses the components provided by the OBS
                Framework, then it can reuse the <a href="#TestSuite">test cases</a> associated to
                these components and it can use their documentation as a target for test coverage
                matrices. This documentation is structured so as to allow precise pin-pointing of
                specific functionalities under test (see <a href="doxygen/html/classTestCaseDummyManoeuvre__1.html">here</a> for an example).
                The test report generated by running the regression test can also be included in an
                application documentation</li>
        </ul></p>
