    <Introduction>
        <p class="links">In a framework context, it is necessary to distinguish between two development processes</p>
        <p class="links"><ul>
            <li>The <i>framework creation process</i> is the process whereby the reusable assets (or
                building blocks) of the framework are created together with the language and tools
                required to instantiate applications from the framework. </li>
            <li>The <i>framework instantiation process</i> is the process whereby the reusable
                assets (or building blocks) of the framework are tailored to match the needs of a
                target application within the framework domainand are used to create the target
                application. </li>
        </ul></p>
        <p class="links">The next figure illustrates the mutual relationship between the framework creation and
            the framework instantiation processes.<p><center><img src="../figures/gif/FrameworkBasedProcess.gif"/></center></p> This web
            site gives access to the information that was generated during the creation process for
            the OBS Framework and it provides the means to support the instantiation proces for
            target applications in the framework domain.</p>
    </Introduction>
    <h3><a name="FrameworkCreation">Framework Creation</a></h3>
        <p class="links">The framework creation process can be divided into three phases:</p>
        <p class="links"><ul>
            <li>The <i>domain analysis</i> phase whereby the target domain of the framework is
                identified and characterized. This phase should normally terminate with the
                construction of a formal domain model.</li>
            <li>The <i>domain design</i> phase whereby the reusable assets (or building blocks) from
                which the framework instances are to be built are identified and formal model for
                them are produced.</li>
            <li>The <i>domain implementation</i> phase whereby the models of the reusable assets (or
                building blocks) from which the framework instances are to be built are implemented
                in code. In many cases, the modelling of the building blocks can be done within an
                environment with autocoding facilities so that this phase will often be very fast.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p class="links">For the OBS Framework, the output of the domain analysis phase is a formal model of the
            target domain of the OBS Framework expressed as a <a HREF="indexModellingApproach.html#FeatureModels" target="_parent">feature model</a>.</p>
        <p class="links"> For the domain design phase, there are three outputs at three levels of abstractions. At
            the <i>abstract design level</i>, the framework design is captured by a <a HREF="indexDesignPatterns.html" target="_parent">set of design patterns</a> that
            propose design solutions for recurring design problems in the OBS domain. The design
            patterns encapsulate reusable architectural solutions for applications within the
            framework domain. At the <i>architectural design level</i>, the framework is described
            by a <a HREF="indexModellingApproach.html#ClassModel">UML class diagram</a> that covers all
            its concrete and abstract classes. At the <i>detailed design level</i>, the framework is
            described by a <a href="doxygen/html/index.html">detailed code description</a>
            automatically generated by the <a href="http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html">doxygen tool</a> by
            processing the framework source code.</p>
        <p class="links">Note that no design-level model is provided for the framework meta-components since no
            well-established modelling techniques exist for this type of building blocks. The
            meta-components are therefore only provided as implementation-level building blocks.</p>
        <p class="links">At implementation level, the OBS Framework is implemented as a set of C++ classes and a
            set of XSL programs. Some of the C++ classes are concrete and implement the framework <a HREF="indexConcreteComponents.html" target="_parent">concrete components</a>, others
            are abstract and implement the framework <a HREF="indexAbstractInterfaces.html" target="_parent">abstract interfaces</a>. The XSL programs implement both the <a HREF="indexGeneratorMeta-Components.html" target="_parent">Generator
            Meta-Components</a> and the <a HREF="indexTransformerMeta-Components.html" target="_parent">Transformer Meta-Components</a>.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="FrameworkInstantiation">Framework Instantiation</a></h3>
        <p class="links">The framework creation process can be divided into three phases:</p>
        <p class="links"><ul>
            <li>An <i>application modelling</i> phase where a model is of the target application is
                constructed. </li>
            <li>A <i>building block tailoring</i> phase where the building blocks provided by the
                framework are adapted to the needs of the target application. The output of this
                phase is a set of application-specific components.</li>
            <li>A <i>component composition</i> phase where the application-specific components are
                composed with each other to construct the target application.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p class="links">The <a HREF="indexModellingApproach.html#ApplicationModel">application model</a> is
            constructed as an instance of the framework model. The application model is expressed as
            an XML document. The OBS Framework provides an XSD Schema that defines the structure of
            this document. The definition of the document itself must of course be done by the
            application designer on the basis of the application requirements. The OBS Framework
            does not at present support the automated derivation of the application model from the
            framework model. This is an object of current research and may be provided in future releases.</p>
        <p class="links">The OBS Framework supports the following adaptation techniques for tailoring its building
            blocks to the needs of a target application:</p>
        <p class="links"><ul>
            <li>
                <i>Component Configuration</i>: the <a HREF="indexConcreteComponents.html" target="_parent">components</a> provided by the OBS Framework or created by
                extending its concrete and abstract classes, are intended to be configured during
                the application configuration phase. Component configuration consists in setting the
                values of the component attributes. Since some component attributes are of class
                type, this includes the <i>object composition</i> adaptation mechanism.</li>
            <li>
                <i>Class Extension</i>: the OBS Framework provides a number of C++ classes that can
                be adapted by extension. This includes both the override of existing methods, the
                definition of virtual methods, and the addition of new methods.</li>
            <li>
                <i>Automatic Code Generation</i>: the OBS framework offers <a HREF="indexGeneratorMeta-Components.html" target="_parent">generator
                meta-components</a> that can generate new application-specific classes from a
                high-level specification provided by the designer. The classes thus generated are
                guaranteed to be plug-compatible with other OBS Framework classes.</li>
            <li>
                <i>Aspect Weaving</i>: the OBS framework offers <a HREF="indexTransformerMeta-Components.html" target="_parent">transformer
                meta-components</a> that implement aspect programs to perform application-specific
                modifications upon the base classes provided by the framework.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p class="links">At present, the OBS Framework does not support the component composition phase. This is
            the phase where the individual components adapted to the specific needs of a target
            application are composed together to construct the final application executable.
            Component composition must currently be performed manually. This type of support is an
            object of current research and may be provided in future releases. Some preliminary work
            was done in the <a href="http://control.ee.ethz.ch/~ceg/AutomatedFrameworkInstantiation" target="_parent">automated framework instantiation project</a>.</p>
