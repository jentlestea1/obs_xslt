    <Introduction>
        <p class="links">This page discusses some issues that are related to the implementation of the OBS
            Framework <a href="doxygen/html/index.html">source code</a> on an embedded target.</p>
    </Introduction>
    <h3><a name="MemoryOccupation">Memory Occupation</a></h3>
        <p class="links">Since a framework is not an application, it is not possible to give a single memory
            occupation figure for the OBS Framework. Most applications instantiated from the
            framework will only use a subset of the classes it offers and hence the impact of the
            framework usage on the memory footprint of the final application may vary. It is however
            possible to gain a qualitative idea of the likely impact by measuring the memory
            occupation of the <a href="indexQualificationApproach.html#TestSuite">
                <code>RegressionTest</code>
            </a> application that runs all the test cases provided by the framework in sequence. The
            results of the measurements are given by the table below.</p>
        <p class="links">The measurements were performed on the SIS ERC32 simulator (version 3.0.5). The
            application was compiled and linked using the ERC32 GNU cross-compiler system (version
            2.0.7). The figures refer to the version of the framework and its regression test as
            they existed in the ObsFramework CVS repository on April 28-th 2004 at 2 pm. It should
            also be noted that measurements on an earlier version of the framework had been
            performed on an ERC32 board by Estec TOS-ESC personnel which demonstrated the
            compatibility of the framework software with a real ERC32 hardware environment.</p>
        <p class="links">At the time of the measurement, the framework consisted of 239 C++ classes (including the
            test case classes). Note also that that <code>RegressionTest</code> application performs
            I/O operations (to write the results of the tests to the standard output) and therefore
            its memory requirements include the applicable library routines. These would obviously
            not be needed in a real embedded applications. The framework classes make extensive use
            of assertions to check pre- and post-conditions and invariants. The assertions were
            however disabled for the measurements (as they would be in a real operational situation).</p>
        <p class="links">The table shows the size of the <code>.text</code>, <code>.data</code>, and
            <code>.bss</code> sections as reported by the SIS simulator when the application is
            loaded. Five sets of measurements were made, corresponding to five different sets of
            compiler options as indicated in the first column. As expected, the most important gain
            arises from the use of the <code>-fno-rtti</code> and <code>-fno-exceptions</code>
            options. The <code>-fno-rtti</code> option removes all code and data related to the use
            of the C++ run-time type information mechanism. The <code>-fno-exceptions</code> removes
            all code and data related to the use of the C++ exception mechanism (recall that the
            framework classes use a very restricted <a href="LanguageSubset.html">subset of the C++
            language</a> that does not use either the RTTI or the exception mechanisms). Taken
            together, these two options basically eliminate the overhead associated to the use of
            the C++ language.</p>
        <p class="links">The compiler options obviously only have an impact on the framework code proper. They do
            not affect the size of the run-time system or of any libraries that are linked into the
            executable. Further gains could be achieved by rebuilding the gcc environment with the
            same options used for the framework. The results of the tests done on the
            <code>hello</code> and <code>empty</code> reference programs (see below in this page)
            however indicate that any such overheads are very small.</p>

        <p class="links">A perspective on the above figures can be gained by comparing them with the corresponding
            figures for some simple reference applications (the source code for the reference
            applications can be found in directory <code>scripts/TestMains</code> of the OBS
            Framework delivery). The next table gives figures for the following reference applications:</p>

        <p class="links">The following remarks apply to the above results:</p>
        <p class="links"><ul>
            <li>There is no difference in the memory occupation of the <code>empty</code> and
                <code>hello</code> programs between the case when they are compiled with the C and
                with the C++ compiler. This suggests that the C++ compiler does not add unnecessary
                overheads with respect to the C compiler when it is compiling code that, though
                embedded within a <code>cpp</code> file, is really plain C code.</li>
            <li>For the <code>empty</code> and <code>hello</code> programs, there is no difference
                between the results with and without RTTI and exception handling because these two
                programs are pure C programs which do not use classes (exception handling and RTTI
                are class-related mechanisms).</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p class="links">The next set of figures explore the impact of the class construct on the memory
            occupation. The following reference applications are considered:</p>
        <p class="links"><ul>
            <li>
                <code>hello.c</code>: the classical 'Hello World' program consisting of a
                <code>main</code> that writes "Hello World" and returns immediately.</li>
            <li>
                <code>helloBaseClass.cpp</code>: a class-based version of the classical 'Hello
                World' program. This program consists of a single class with a dummy constructor
                that returns without taking any action and a single <code>printHelloWorld</code>
                method that writes "Hello World" and returns immediately. The main program
                instantiates the class on the stack and calls its method <code>printHelloWorld</code>.</li>
            <li>
                <code>helloDerivedClass.cpp</code>: a class-based version of the classical 'Hello
                World' program that includes a base and a derived classe with one pure virtual
                methods. This program consists of two classes: a base class and a derived class that
                extends the base class. The base class defines a dummy constructor that returns
                without taking any action and a pure virtual method <code>printHelloWorld</code>.
                The derived class defines a dummy constructor that returns without doing anything
                and it provides an implementation for the method <code>printHelloWorld</code> that
                writes "Hello World" and returns immediately. The main program instantiates the
                derived class on the stack and calls its method <code>printHelloWorld</code>.</li>

        <p class="links">The following remarks apply to the above results:</p>
        <p class="links"><ul>
            <li>There is basically no difference in the memory occupation of the <code>hello</code>
                and <code>helloBaseClass</code> programs. Their functionality is the same but the
                former is implemented as a pure C program whereas the latter is implemented as a C++
                program that uses the class construct with only non-virtual methods. The essential
                equality in memory footprint for the two applications indicates that the use of the
                class construct - as long as only non-virtual methods are used - does not introduce
                any memory overheads. The small difference in memory occupation (less than 100
                bytes) is probably due to the code that implements the class constructors.</li>
            <li>There is a very large difference in memory occupation between the
                <code>helloBaseClass</code> and the <code>helloDerivedClass</code> programs when
                only the <code>-O</code> compiler option is used. The second program differs from
                the first one because it uses class extension and pure virtual methods. The extra
                code probably originates in the RTTI and exception handling mechanisms. This is
                suggested by the fact that when the "<code>-O -fno-rtti -fno-exceptions</code>"
                compiler options are used (which remove all RTTI and exception handling), then the
                memory overhead with respect to the simple <code>hello</code> program disappears
                almost completely. This again indicates that the use of these compiler options
                removes all overheads due to the C++ language.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p class="links">Finally, memory occupation was measured for a <i>sample application</i>. Except for its
            main program (which can be found in directory<code>src/cpp/SampleApplication</code>, the
            sample application was entirely generated automatically by running the generator
            meta-components (first the <a href="indexGeneratorMeta-Components.html#Instantiators">instantiators</a> and then the <a href="indexGeneratorMeta-Components.html#Configurers">configurers</a>) on the <a href="indexModellingApproach.html#ApplicationModel">sample application model</a>. The
            resulting application is far from representative of a real on-board application but,
            unlike the programs considered above, it only contains framework classes (i.e. no I/O
            libraries). The total number of concrete classes that are explicitly defined in the
            sample application model is 101. The real number of concrete classes used by the sample
            application may be slightly higher due to components that are "pulled in" without being
            explicitly defined in the application model (such as the dynamic factory components).
            The total number of classes included in the executable is of course still higher because
            it includes all the non-concrete classes that are used by the instantiated classes. The
            memory usage figures for this sample application are as follows:</p>

        <p class="links">Most OBS Framework classes are independent of the byte ordering policy adopted by the

            <cls>DC_BasicPUSTcLoader</cls>). The assumptions made by the providers of the
            telecommand data or by the users of the telemetry data may not be consistent with the
            byte ordering policy enforced by the processor upon which the framework code runs. The
            transfer of data between the internal data structures used by the framework classes and
            the buffers holding the telecommand and telemetry images is always made using the
            <code>memcpy</code> standard C routine. Byte ordering inconsistencies could therefore be
            resolved, without touching the framework source code, by providing a new implementation
            for this routine.</p>
    
    <h3><a name="AlignmentConstraints">Alignment Constraints</a></h3>
        <p class="links">Some compiler and some processors enforce particular alignment constraints. The OBS
            Framework code has been written to be independent of these constraints. The regression
            tests provided by the <a href="indexQualificationApproach.html#TestSuite">framework test
            suite</a>, in particular, run without changes both on an Intel PC with the Microsoft
            VisualStudio compiler an Intel PC - to which no alignment constraints apply - and on the
            SPARC-based ERC32 with the gcc compiler - for which alignment constraints apply.</p>
